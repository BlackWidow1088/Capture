----------

There are surprisingly few complex, open-source examples of Redux applications. Managing relational data in a non-trivial app is not an easy task, and yet there aren't many good examples.

The main purpose of this project is to show one method of managing redux state across a large-ish application.

This repo strives to be modern. It uses:

- React Router v4
- Redux Saga
- Reselect
- Create React App, unejected (for as long as possible)
- AirBnb ESLint config
